## Goal

Prove byte-for-byte determinism of generated outputs by:

- making ordering explicitly stable wherever it can affect emitted artifacts,
- adding tests that catch nondeterministic output behavior.

---

## Work

1. Inventory any ordering derived from:
   - `Object.keys/values/entries()`
   - `Map` iteration where construction order is not guaranteed by input
2. Make ordering explicit (sort keys, stable topological order, stable component ordering).
3. Add tests that run generation twice and assert identical outputs.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- Deterministic output is proven by tests for representative fixtures.
- There are no nondeterministic iteration-based orderings left in output-critical paths.
