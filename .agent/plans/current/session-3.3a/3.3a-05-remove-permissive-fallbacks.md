# Plan: 3.3a.05 — Remove Permissive Fallback Outputs

**Status:** 🔲 Not Started

**Parent:** [roadmap.md](../../roadmap.md) (Session 3.3a)

## Goal

Remove “catch + warn + return permissive output” behavior from product code.

This repo is strict everywhere: unsupported/invalid inputs must fail fast with helpful errors.

---

## Repo Truth

- `lib/src/schema-processing/conversion/json-schema/convert-schema.ts` currently catches, logs, and returns permissive output.

---

## Work

1. Replace permissive fallbacks with explicit error throws (include context).
2. Add tests that prove:
   - the error is thrown,
   - the message includes enough context to act.
3. Ensure the strict pipeline cannot return a “best-effort” schema.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- No permissive fallback outputs remain in the library.
- Tests assert failure modes and error messages (not just “throws”).
