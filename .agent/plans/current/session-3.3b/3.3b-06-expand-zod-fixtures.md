# Plan: 3.3b.06 — Expand Zod Fixture Coverage (Union, Intersection, Recursion)

**Status:** 🔲 Not Started  
**Priority:** Low  
**Created:** 2026-02-13  
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-13  
**Parent:** [roadmap.md](../../roadmap.md) (Session 3.3b)

---

## Goal

Add Zod fixtures that target known hard areas:

- unions and discriminated unions
- intersections (`.and`)
- recursion patterns

These fixtures must be covered by strict round-trip and validation-parity tests.

---

## Responsibility Boundary

**Begins after:** [3.3b.05 — Validation-Parity Scenarios 2–4](3.3b-05-validation-parity-scenarios-2-4.md)
**This plan owns:** Adding fixture files and wiring them into the test suite. Ensuring coverage of known-hard patterns.
**This plan does NOT own:** Fixing parser/writer bugs exposed by new fixtures (those feed back into earlier plans).
**Successor:** [3.3b.07 — Nullability Chain Normalization](3.3b-07-nullability-chain-normalization.md)

---

## Work

1. Add fixtures under `lib/tests-fixtures/zod-parser/` (or existing fixture folder).
2. Update round-trip suite to include them.
3. Add targeted assertions for semantics that historically regress.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- Fixture set covers unions, intersections, recursion.
- All fixture scenarios are exercised by strict tests.
