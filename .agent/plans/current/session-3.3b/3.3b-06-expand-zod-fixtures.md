# Plan: 3.3b.06 — Expand Zod Fixture Coverage (Union, Intersection, Recursion)

## Goal

Add Zod fixtures that target known hard areas:

- unions and discriminated unions
- intersections (`.and`)
- recursion patterns

These fixtures must be covered by strict round-trip and validation-parity tests.

---

## Work

1. Add fixtures under `lib/tests-fixtures/zod-parser/` (or existing fixture folder).
2. Update round-trip suite to include them.
3. Add targeted assertions for semantics that historically regress.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- Fixture set covers unions, intersections, recursion.
- All fixture scenarios are exercised by strict tests.
