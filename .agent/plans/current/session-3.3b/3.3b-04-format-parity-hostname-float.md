# Plan: 3.3b.04 — Zod Writer Format Parity (Queue Mirror)

**Status:** ℹ️ Mirror (non-authoritative)  
**Priority:** High  
**Created:** 2026-02-13  
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-19 (activated in `.agent/plans/active/`)  
**Parent:** [roadmap.md](../../roadmap.md) (Session 3.3b)

---

## Canonical Source

Use the active plan as the single source of truth:

- [`.agent/plans/active/3.3b-04-format-parity-hostname-float.md`](../../active/3.3b-04-format-parity-hostname-float.md)

---

## Why This Mirror Exists

This queue file is retained for sequence readability inside `session-3.3b`, but it must not diverge from the active plan.

- Do not update execution details here.
- Apply all edits to the active plan file.
- Treat this file as a pointer only.

---

## Successor

Next queued plan remains: [3.3b.05 — Validation-Parity Scenarios 2–4](3.3b-05-validation-parity-scenarios-2-4.md)
