# Open Questions

Register of non-urgent unresolved planning, design, or process questions —
questions that shape future work but do not block any current cycle. Urgent
or cycle-blocking questions belong in the active plan or an owner escalation,
not here. Answered or withdrawn entries are drained at `consolidate-docs`.

Each entry should carry: a `Q-NNN` id, a `Captured` provenance stamp, the
question, why it shapes future work, why it is not cheaply answerable now, its
owning artefact / discussion home (if any), and a status line.

> **Materialised 2026-06-18 (Practice transplant Phase 6).** The register is new
> in castr; entries are populated from castr's own state by the Phase-6 napkin
> drain and later consolidation passes — not copied from any other repo.

_Register empty (2026-06-26). Q-006 graduated to ADR-049; Q-007 decided by the owner (markdown-links gate
end-state → scoped-blocking on transplant-completed surfaces, recorded in the transplant-completeness plan
TC3b). The permanent homes are the record, not a tombstone here. New questions are appended below by future
drains and consolidation passes._

### Q-008 — should the machine-local-paths invariant also clean `archive/` before any publish?

`Captured: 2026-06-28 | source: LC3a (machine-local-paths validator) consolidation`

**Question:** the `no-machine-local-paths` rule's own Detection scope exempts `archive/` (frozen historical
records), and the LC3a validator + write-time guard honour that exemption. But archived napkins still contain
real user-home segments (e.g. `/Users/<user>/...`) that would leak a username (PII) if the repo is ever made
public. Should there be a publish-time (or pre-publish) pass that de-PII's archives, or is the archive-exemption
acceptable because castr is private?

**Why it shapes future work:** it is a release/publication-boundary decision (affects whether a public-repo move
needs an archive-scrubbing step), and it is the kind of latent PII exposure that is cheap to fix before publish
and expensive after.

**Why not cheaply answerable now:** depends on the owner's intent for ever publishing this repo, and on whether
archives should be rewritten (history-altering) vs scrubbed-at-export. Owner-decision-class.

**Owning artefact:** the `no-machine-local-paths` rule + the LC3 lane (`practice-loop-closure-remediation.md`).
**Status:** open — surfaced to owner at the LC3a closeout (2026-06-28).

### Q-009 — how to renumber the 23 incoming Oak PDRs given the 096/097 collision?

`Captured: 2026-06-28 | source: Oak→castr gap rescan`

**Question:** the bring backlog includes 23 Oak PDRs (Oak 096–119). castr's own PDR-096
(bring-the-iceberg) and PDR-097 (dependency-currency) are castr-originals occupying those
numbers — Oak's 096/097 are different PDRs. So the cross-repo PDR-number correspondence
(shared for 001–095) already broke at 096. Bringing Oak's 096–119 needs a renumbering scheme:
(a) import Oak's as castr 098+ (accept permanent number-skew from Oak), or (b) renumber
castr's two originals and take Oak's 096/097 (restore correspondence, churn castr refs), or
(c) a mapping table. **Why it shapes future work:** every one of the 23 PDR brings + their
cross-references depends on the scheme; choosing late means rework. **Why not cheaply now:**
governance decision about the castr↔Oak PDR-numbering invariant (is shared numbering a goal?).
**Owning artefact:** `oak-castr-gap-rescan-2026-06-28.md` §PDRs. **Status:** open — owner-facing.

### Q-010 — reconcile principles.md `Result<T,E>` examples with castr's fail-fast doctrine

`Captured: 2026-06-28 | source: Oak→castr gap rescan (use-result-pattern reclassification)`

**Question:** `.agent/directives/principles.md` carries `Result<T,E>` error-handling examples
(lines 854/939/1199/1796) while castr's codebase doctrine is fail-fast/throw (it rejected
`@oaknational/result`→throw in the D4 lane, and declined to bring Oak's `use-result-pattern`
rule on those grounds). The rescan surfaced this as a castr-internal doctrine-vs-reality
tension. **Resolution path:** rewrite principles.md's Result examples to throw-based, OR scope
`Result<T,E>` to a narrow explicitly-allowed use and state the boundary. **Why not cheaply
now:** needs an owner call on whether Result has any sanctioned place in castr or is fully
superseded by fail-fast. **Owning artefact:** `principles.md` + `oak-castr-gap-rescan-2026-06-28.md`
§Firsthand corrections. **Status:** open — castr-internal cleanup, owner-facing.

_Transplant decisions (delivery framing, single-TS-override, statusline, release tooling, hook-matcher
precision) are carried by
