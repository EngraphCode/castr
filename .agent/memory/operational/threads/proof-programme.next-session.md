# Next-Session Record — Proof programme (autonomous loop)

The continuity record for the proof-programme thread: the ADR-051 autonomous
background loop executing the parent plan's queue, three scheduled firings per
day plus owner-attended interactive sessions. Indexed by
[`../repo-continuity.md § Active Threads`](../repo-continuity.md#active-threads);
this record carries identity history per [`README.md`](README.md) +
[PDR-027](../../../practice-core/decision-records/PDR-027-threads-sessions-and-agent-identity.md).

**Lane-state authority lives in the programme's own surfaces**, not here: the
queue and counters in
[`parent-plan.md`](../../../plans/proof-programme/parent-plan.md) frontmatter,
incidents in [`incidents.md`](../../../plans/proof-programme/incidents.md),
owner decisions in
[`queued-decisions.md`](../../../plans/proof-programme/queued-decisions.md).
This record adds only what those surfaces do not carry: the additive PDR-027
identity table. Scheduled firings update their identity row here at close per
the routine prompt's firing-scoped handoff profile (QD-6).

## Participating agent identities

Additive per PDR-027 — joining adds an identity; a matching platform/model/agent_name
updates `last_session` rather than adding a row. (Sessions predating this record —
the W-0/Q-00/Q-01 authoring sessions and the first firings — are recorded in the
programme's delivery evidence rather than retro-filled here.)

## Next-session landing target

Per PDR-026, externally verifiable, re-derived each session from the queue
rather than trusted from this record: **drive the single open non-draft
programme PR to merged, else claim the next eligible queue row** (as recorded
2026-08-25: the Q-04 slice PR on `claude/dazzling-cannon-1do9ve` is the open PR to
drive if not yet merged; else claim the next eligible row). Verification: the PR
merged, or a row's state advanced on the base.

## Session shape and grounding order

Scheduled firings follow the routine prompt end to end (it is the grounding
order); owner-attended interactive sessions ground via `start-right-quick`
and then follow the parent plan's §Operating protocol. Either shape updates
this record's identity table at close.

## Standing decisions

The governing ADR (autonomous-background-implementation-loop) and the
programme's queued-decisions register carry every standing decision; this
record points and never duplicates. The queue frontmatter and incident
register are the live lane state.
