  Fitness on a drainable buffer is a drain-cadence signal, not a size cap. The
  register reads `hard` while an owner-gated backlog waits to be walked down with
  the owner present; it goes green when the backlog is genuinely graduated, not by
  tombstone-removal. Fitness here is informational-only (not wired into any
  commit/push hook), so a standing `hard` never blocks a commit and must be
  reported, not chased: owner-gated items that legitimately wait are never trimmed
  to clear it. Materialised fresh in castr by the Practice transplant (Phase 6,
  2026-06-18); the register starts near-empty and is populated by napkin drains and
  consolidation passes.

# Pending Graduations

This is the canonical pending-graduations register. Do not create dated,
windowed, backlog, split, or shard-like pending-graduation files. New capture,
owner-gated items, and unresolved pending-graduation decisions belong here until
they graduate, duplicate, become stale-withdrawn, or receive owner direction.

Each entry should record: the captured substance, its candidate permanent home
(PDR / ADR / rule / distilled / pattern / README), and a
`[captured: <date> | source: <surface>]` provenance stamp. When an item
graduates, route its substance to the permanent home and remove it here — the
commit and the permanent doc are the record (no tombstone; see
[`permanent-doc-is-the-consolidation-record`](../../rules/permanent-doc-is-the-consolidation-record.md)).

> **Materialised 2026-06-18 (Practice transplant Phase 6).** The register is new
> in castr. Items below are populated by napkin drains and consolidation passes
> from castr's own state — not copied from any other repo.
